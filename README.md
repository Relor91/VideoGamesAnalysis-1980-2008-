# WORK IN PROGRESS -- Video Games Sales Analysis (1980-2008)
Prepare to embark for a ride that will take us far back to the 80s, the golden age of Video Games, an age shaped by events which will influence and lay the foundations for the modern Videogames era.

# A bit of History...
<img src="https://relor91.github.io/Lorenzo_Portfolio/images/Arcades.jpg" alt="drawing" height = "550" width="500" align="left"/>It all began in 1947 when computer scientists decided to make the first step into human-computer interactions which brought them to make
the very first interactive game with an electronic display. Amongst those early games there was OXO, a videogame which simulated the game of noughts and crosses.
Along with the introduction of the cathode-ray tube screens, videogames will represent the first playful interaction between man and machine.
It's the 70s now and Videogames have just taken to the malls with the first arcade videogame released in 1971 called 'Computer Space',
 followed in 1972 by the first home videogame console 'Magnavox Odyssey', a brown white and black rectangular box with two wired controllers with knobs, probably not the controller you are thinking right now but a more arcaic version.
Half a decade later and we are in 1976, the year that will change home consoles forever with the invention of interchangeable games cartridges called ROMs,
 while just two years later the videogame 'Space Invaders' will literally invade Arcades and will prove to be the highest grossing videogame at the time.
This is just the beginning for the newly emerged Videogames Industry which will fill the malls with videogame cabinets, and houses with consoles.
 

# Consoles, consoles & consoles!

 By the end of the 70s and the beginning of the 80s the market was flooded with consoles, but one american company was the lead: <strong>Atari</strong>.
Atari 2600 home console was released in 1977 and was kicking it until the <strong>Videogames Crash of 1983</strong>.
The crash began destabilizing the industry since 1982 and worsened in 1983 due to a variety of factors:
<p align=center><p> 1)Too <strong>many</strong> small calibre <strong>consoles</strong> on the market.
<p> 2)The <strong>lack of publishing controls</strong> caused by the complete lack of credits to the developers which began writing games under
 their own names.
<p> 3)Atari's <strong>E.T.</strong> which saw millions of copies being refunded in Christmas 1982 due to the game's poor design.</p>
<p> 4)Atari's console-version of <strong>Pac-Man</strong> which resembled nothing like the Arcade experience.</p>

<br>
Videogames market was very unstable in 1982, and videogame Titan Atari registered a loss of <strong>900 Millions</strong> with E.T. & Pac-Man flops alone.
A year in which home consoles games resembled nothing like the Arcade experience, a small toys company in Japan was going to revive the videogames market: <strong>Nintendo</strong>.
